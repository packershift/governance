## Indentation

- Use 4 spaces for indentation.
- Do not use tabs for indentation.

## Line Length

- Limit lines of code to a maximum of 80 characters. This makes it easier to read the code on a variety of devices and in different environments.

## Naming Conventions

- Use camelCase for variable and function names.
- Use PascalCase for class and struct names.
- Use snake_case for constants and enum values.
- Use meaningful and descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.

## Commenting

- Use comments to explain the purpose of the code and how it works.
- Use a single line comment for brief explanations, and a multi-line comment for more detailed explanations.
- Use the `//` symbol to start single-line comments.
- Use the `/*` and `*/` symbols to start and end multi-line comments.
- Place comments on a separate line above the code they describe.
- Do not include comments that are redundant with the code.

## Spacing

- Use a single space before and after operators.
- Use a single blank line to separate logical blocks of code.
- Do not use more than one blank line in a row.

## Formatting

- Use brackets for all control structures, even if the body contains only one statement.
- Place the opening bracket on the same line as the control structure keyword.
- Place the closing bracket on a new line.
- Use parentheses for all function calls and expressions.
- Do not use unnecessary parentheses.

## Error Handling

- Use exceptions to indicate errors.
- Do not use error codes or status flags to indicate errors.
- Catch exceptions as close to the point where they are thrown as possible.
- Do not catch exceptions you cannot handle.

## Coding Conventions

- Use inheritance to model a "is-a" relationship.
- Use composition to model a "has-a" relationship.
- Use interfaces to define a contract.
- Avoid using global variables and singletons.
- Avoid using magic numbers and hard-coded constants.
- Keep functions and methods small and focused.
- Do not use goto statements.

## Testing

- Write tests for all new code.
- Make sure all tests pass before submitting a pull request.
- Use a test framework such as JUnit or NUnit.
- Write tests that cover all branches of the code.
- Use assert statements to check for expected results.

## Best Practices

- Keep the code simple and easy to understand.
- Avoid writing overly complex code.
- Follow the SOLID principles.
- Follow the DRY principle.
- Avoid premature optimization.
- Write self-documenting code.
- Use version control and maintain a clean git history.
